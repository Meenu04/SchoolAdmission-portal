        During kindergarten years, we instill in our children the foundations of humane learning and foster the capacity for effective critical inquiry and authentic self-expression. Our core curriculum is theme based, activity oriented and multi-sensory covering various areas of learning such as language and communication, numeracy, gross and fine motor skills, emotional and social skills, as well as creative and musical skills. Children learn through a wide range of engaging activities such as storytelling, role play, clay modelling,
        play and learn, art and culture, sensory games, outdoor learning and field trips. To develop observation, physical and motor skills we
        follow experiential learning approach. 
        The program has proven well in building thinking and problem solving skills in children.
        Children learn to ask more questions, can write in their own words, like doing word problems in mathematics, can complete their
        homework on their own, are not afraid to speak-up in English and persist longer in solving problems.</h2>
